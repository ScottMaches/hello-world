# hello-world
My first repository
Scott Maches, started out in tech as a support contractor, moved to developing go live support plans for enterprise-wide application releases, then front end development. After that moved on to BSA role and then Product Manager in the data management space, focusing on Power BI. I am now prepping for the Power BI cert exam.
